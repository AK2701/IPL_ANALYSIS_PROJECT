# IPL_ANALYSIS_PROJECT

Welcome to my IPL project! In this project, I have analyzed the performance of various IPL teams and players using data from previous IPL seasons. 
Through this project, I aim to provide insights into the key factors that contribute to a team's success in the IPL, as well as the individual player 
statistics that impact the game. I have used various data analysis techniques and visualization tools to make the findings of this project easily 
understandable and accessible to all. I hope you find this project informative and engaging!

BATSMAN

A) METRICS

A.a) DATA-FRAME USED
* DELIVERY WITHOUT SUPER OVER
* DELIVERIES WITHOUT SUPER OVER, WIDE RUNS, NO BALL RUNS
* BATSMAN INNINGS PLAYED => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY

1 HARD HITTING ABILITY

1.1) DATA-FRAME USED 
* BALLS_PLAYED => CALCULATE USING DELIVERIES
* NUM_FOUR => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY
* NUM_SIX => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY

1.2) FORMULA USED AND WHY ?
* (NUM_FOUR + NUM_SIX) / BALLS_PLAYED 
* ??

2 FINISHING ABILITY

2.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* BATSMAN INNINGS PLAYED
* NOT OUT INNINGS PLAYED => USING DELIVERY => LOGIC (TOTAL INNINGS PLAYED - NUMBER OF TIMES OUT)

2.2) LOGIC USED AND WHY?
* NOT OUT INNINGS/ TOTAL INNINGS
* ??

3 CONSISTENCY

3.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* BATSMAN RUNS USING DELIVERY
* NUMBER OF TIMES OUT USING DELIVERY

3.2) LOGIC USED AND WHY ?
* RUNS / NUMBER OF NOT OUT
* ??

4 RUNNING RUNS

4.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* BATSMAN RUNS USING DELIVERY
* NUM_FOUR
* NUM_SIX
* RUNNING RUNS => USING DELIVERY => BATSMAN_RUNS - ((NUM_FOUR*4)+(NUM_SIX*6))
* BALLS_PLAYED
* NON_BOUNDARY_BALLS => BALLS_PLAYED - (NUM_FOUR + NUM_SIX)

4.2) LOGIC USED AND WHY ?
* RUNNING RUNS / NON_BOUNDARY_BALLS


B) GRAPHS

B.a) DATA-FRAME USED
* DELIVERY WITHOUT SUPER OVER
* DELIVERIES WITHOUT SUPER OVER, WIDE RUNS, NO BALL RUNS
* BATSMAN INNINGS PLAYED => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY
* SEASON =>{‘MATCH_ID’  ,  ‘SEASON’}

1 BATSMAN RUN VARIATION
2 BATSMAN STRIKERATE VARIATION
3 NUMBER OF BOUNDARIES
4 BATTING AVERAGE
5 BATTING STRIKE RATE V/S AVERAGE
6 NUMBER OF SIXES AND FOURS
7 BATTING STRIKE RATE V/S RUN SCORED

BOWLER

A) METRICS

A.a) DATA-FRAME USED
* DELIVERY WITHOUT SUPER OVER
* DELIVERIES WITHOUT SUPER OVER, WIDE RUNS, NO BALL RUNS
* BOWLER INNINGS PLAYED => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY

1 ECONOMY

1.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* RUNS => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY
* NUM_BALLS => CALCULATE USING DELIVERIES

1.2) LOGIC USED AND WHY ?
* RUNS / NUM_BALLS 
* ??

2 WICKET_TAKING_ABILITY

2.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* NUM_BALLS => CALCULATE USING DELIVERIES
* WIC_TAKEN_OVERALL => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY + RUN_OUT REMOVED

2.2) LOGIC USED AND WHY ?
* NUM_BALLS / WIC_TAKEN_OVERALL
* ??

3 CONSISTENCY

3.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* BOWLER_RUN_CONCIDED USING DELIVERY => SUMING(WIDE_RUNS + NOBALL_RUNBS + BATSMAN_RUNS)
* WIC_TAKEN_OVERALL => CALCULATE USING DELIVERY + RUN_OUT REMOVED
   
3.2)  LOGIC USED AND WHY ?
* BOWLER_RUN_CONCIDED / WIC_TAKEN
* ??


4 CRITICAL_WICKET_TAKING_ABILITY

3.1) DATA-FRAME USED
* WICKET_TAKEN_PER_MATCH USING DELIVERY 
* NUM_TIMES_CRITICAL_WICKET_TAKEN (WICKET_TAKEN_PER_MATCH >=4 THEN VALUE COUNTS BOWLER)

B) GRAPHS

B.a) DATA-FRAME USED
* DELIVERY WITHOUT SUPER OVER
* DELIVERIES WITHOUT SUPER OVER, WIDE RUNS, NO BALL RUNS
* SEASON =>{‘MATCH_ID’  ,  ‘SEASON’}

1 ECONOMY VARIATION

1.1) DATA FRAME USED
* RUNS_PER_YEAR => USING DELIVERY
* BALLS_BOWLED_PER_YEAR => USING DELIVERIES

2 YEARLY WICKET TAKEN

2.1) DATA FRAME USED
* YEARLY_WICK_TAKEN => USING DELIVERY + REMOVING RUN_OUT

3 YEARLY CONSISTENCY

3.1) DATA FRAME USED
* BOWLER_RUN_CONCIDED_YEARLY => SUMING(WIDE_RUNS + NOBALL_RUNBS + BATSMAN_RUNS)
* YEARLY_WICK_TAKEN => USING DELIVERY + REMOVING RUN_OUT
